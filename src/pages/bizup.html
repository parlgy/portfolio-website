                    An online platform where students can buy and sell second hand products. Because the case study was time sensitive, I resolved to conducting Design Sprint as a 
                    way to come up with a quick solution creatively while involving everyone who was part of the project.

                    I was mandated to develop with an application that students would use to sell and buy second-hand products. The application needed to be user-friendly and intuitive. The main problem that we were to solve through the
                    design was churning, considering there were some already available platforms performing the same functionality. The main problem was how they will have a steady number of daily users.The deal was we focus on a small scale i.e. the universities and then later expand.
                    The semester was almost to a conclusion and they wanted to launch the product before it does. And so I conducted a Sprint which was to take five days and by the end, we were to have a prototype of the project.

                    So I involved everyone who was to be part of the project  i.e. CEO, marketing manager, developers and others. We were seven in number. We were to have Five hour daily sessions for five days. Then I gave them the Design Sprint brief that I came up with
                    so that everyone was on the same page. The brief contained goals and questions that needed to be answered by the end of the sprint.

                    The marketing team had already data that they collected from various students during their user research which was an epic thing because it also helped us have insights on our target users.

                      <li>We decided to include stores because one store could provide many items providing market to multiple users. A store owner was to have a different account and subscription plan than the normal user account.</li>
                      <li>We included a chat section where the buyers would bargain the prices of products with the sellers.</li>
                      <li>We provided the ability of normal users to upload their items too. </li>

                            I as the sole designer took the solutions that we come up with an came up with a high fidelity mockup which was given to the developers who come up with a simple version of the application 
                            that we would test with users. The prototype only contained features of the application that we thought were the best for user testing.

                               This was the last day of the sprint. We gathered some users and one by one had them use the prototype. We were very keen to observe areas that they
                               were interested most with and areas they skipped. This was to enable us to make adjustments to what might suit the users.

                              We observed the reactions of the users and made some adjustments to the applications. These adjustments included adding an informative onboarding pages.
                              We continued with this process as the users tested the application until we were confident with the results.
