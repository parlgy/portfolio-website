        <p class="text-base text-gray-700 md:text-lg sm:px-4 lg:px-0 text-left">
          Following the miniature survey we held on a couple of students, we noticed that the main form of advertisement of businesses started by students was mostly through whatsapp. This limited the amount of students one can reach since this was dependent on the user's contacts. Very few had the energy to do a door to door advertisement. This method of advertising is time consuming and tiring for the user. Most of the time the user might end up not even selling a single product after spending the whole day doing door to door marketing of his/her product. The method is also in-efficient since the userâ€™s business is limited by his/her social group thus giving him a very low growth potential.

                    It was important that everyone in the team to have knowledge about the problem that was to be solved. We had light talks concerning the problem and the CEO also emphasized on how solving the problem would bring value
                    to the company. This would help everyone from not diverting from the main objective.
                    The marketing team had already data that they collected from various students during their user research which was an epic thing because it also helped us have insights on our target users.

                    In day 2, we used the knowledge of the problem statement we generated previously to come up with with solution. Each individual was to come up with a solution and this was to be done using a pen and paper since we had among us
	                people with no knowledge on design tools. Everyone was to participate because each individuals idea was very important.
	               Everyone was to arrange his/her solutions to form a storyboard which he/she had to explain.

                        This was one of the most important phase as we were to choose a solution that we would prototype to test with users. The decision on what solution to be chosen was to be agreed by everyone and therefore it was important
	                      for everybody to participate.We were also to look at how our solutions might conflict our objectives and goals. Each individuals idea was to be reviewed carefully.

                      <li>We included a chat section where the buyers would bargain the prices of products with the sellers.</li>
